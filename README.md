# Gravity-Method-Tutorial
This tutorial is about forward modeling of simple model gravity anomaly using python.
We are using Jupyter Notebook so some useful brief explanation and illustration could be added along with the code.
It is suitable for students or lecturer in geophysics.
The code is simple and the exercise will give better understanding about forward modeling.
We intent to add more tutorial such as analysis spectral, separating the anomaly, etc.
